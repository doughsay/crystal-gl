# GL

Idiomatic Crystal OpenGL bindings

## Usage

Add it to your `shard.yml`:

```yml
dependencies:
  ...
  gl:
    github: doughsay/crystal-gl
  ...
```

See my [Cube Demo](https://github.com/doughsay/crystal-cube) for an example of how to use this library.

## WIP

This is very much a Work In Progress, only the functions needed to run my demo apps have been added. As I need other functions I will add them, but if anyone else is interested in using this, please feel free to open pull-requests adding OpenGL functions that are missing.
